# artillery

## Setup

- Download the project with `git clone https://github.com/a11ce/artillery.git`.
- Run with `python3 artillery.py` or `./artillery.py`

## How to play

- Each tank is represented by a colored box, purple for player 1 and blue for player 2.
- Each player enters a firing elevation angle (in degrees) and power, then both shots are fired at the same time.
- The closer a shell lands to a tank, the more health it loses.
- The player whose tank loses all its health first loses the game.
